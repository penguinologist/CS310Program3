<h3>The program</h3>

<p>You will create a <em>statically indexed file</em> on a simulated disk.  The
simulated disk will be an instance of the disk class described below and can be
viewed as an array of "sectors."  Each sector will hold 512 characters.  The
indexed file will be arranged on the disk in three groups of sectors:  the
first (and largest) block of sectors will hold <em>data</em>, (the "records"),
the second will hold the <em>index</em>, and the third will be <em>overflow</em>
sectors. The index will be a <em>multi-way tree</em>. These sectors will
together be an instance of the <em>IndexedFile</em> class.
</p>

<p>
You will also write a simple application which will create a disk and an
indexed file using data to be provided to you.
</p>

<h3>The Disk class</h3>

<p>
You will create a <tt>Disk</tt> class.  The disk used for this program will 
then be an instance of this class.  A disk will be a two dimensional array of 
<tt>char</tt>, i.e. an array of <tt>char</tt> arrays.  You should view this as 
an array of <em>sectors</em> where each sector is an array of characters.  The 
number of sectors in a disk and the size of the sectors is arbitrary, but a 
default size is 10,000 sectors on a disk with 512 characters in each sector.  
The class definition for disk is:</p>

<tt><blockquote><pre>public class Disk
{
   private int sectorCount;   // sectors on the disk
   private int sectorSize;    // characters in a sector
   private char[][] store;    // all disk data is stored here
   public Disk()    // for default sectorCount and sectorSize
   {}
   public Disk(int sectorCount, int sectorSize)
   {}
   public void readSector(int sectorNumber, char[] buffer)   // sector to 
   {}                                                        // buffer
   public void writeSector(int sectorNumber, char[] buffer)  // buffer to
   {}                                                        // sector 
   public int getSectorCount()
   {
      return sectorCount;
   }
   public int getSectorSize()
   {
      return sectorSize;
   }
}
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<p>
<tt>sectorCount</tt> is the number of sectors in the disk and 
<tt>sectorSize</tt> is the number of characters in a sector.  <tt>char[][]
store</tt> is a reference to the 2-dimensional array which must be allocated by 
the constructor.
</p>

<h3>Reading and writing to the disk</h3>

<p>
You can only read and write to the disk <em>a sector at a time.</em>  A 
<em>disk buffer</em> which is a character array of the same size as a sector 
must be available.  The <tt>writeSector</tt> method will copy the contents 
of its second parameter (which should be your disk buffer) to the sector whose 
number is the first argument.  The previous contents of the sector will be 
overwritten. The <tt>readSector</tt> method will copy the contents of 
the sector whose number is the first parameter to the character array which is 
the second parameter.  All access to the disk will be through these two 
methods.  (Note:  The disk buffer you will use will be part of the 
IndexedFile class described below.)
</p>

<h3>Indexed files</h3>

<p>
A <em>direct access file</em> stores records in such a way that a record can be 
read or written to the file without reading or writing the entire file.  Each 
record must contain a unique <em>key</em> field.  The value of this key field
(the "key") will be used to determine where the record is stored on the disk. 
The record can then be read given only the key.  One implementation of direct
access file is <em>statically indexed file</em>.  You will implement indexed
files by
creating an <tt>IndexedFile</tt> class with the following class definition:
</p>

<tt><blockquote><pre>public class IndexedFile
{
   private Disk disk;             // disk on which the file will be written
   private char[] buffer;         // disk buffer
   private int recordSize;        // in characters
   private int keySize;           // in characters
   private indexRecordSize;       // in characters
   // fields describing data portion of file
   private int recordsPerSector;  // sectorSize/recordSize
   private int firstAllocated;    // sector number where data begins
   private int sectorsAllocated;  // sectors originally allocated for data
   private int overflowStart;     // sector number where overflow begins
   private int overflowSectors;   // count of overflow sectors in use
   // fields describing index portion of file
   private int indexStart;        // sector number where index begins
   private int indexSectors;      // number of sectors allocated for index
   private int indexRoot;         // sector number of root of index
   private int indexLevels;       // number of levels of index
   
   public IndexedFile(Disk disk, int recordSize, int keySize, int
                      indexRecordSize int firstAllocated, int indexStart,
                      int indexSectors, int indexRoot, int indexLevels)
   {}
   public boolean insertRecord(char[] record)
   {}   
   public boolean findRecord(char[] record)
   {}   
   // there is no delete operation
   private int getSector(char[] key)   // returns sector number indicated by key
   {}  
   
}
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<p>
The <tt>insertRecord</tt> method will take an entire record as a
parameter.  The first several characters (as determined by <tt>keySize</tt>)
are the key.  The <tt>findRecord</tt> method will take a character
array <em>the length of</em> a record as a parameter.  The first 
<tt>keySize</tt> characters of this array will hold the key of the record being 
searched for.  <tt>findRecord</tt> will then overwrite this array with the 
entire record if it is found in the file.   If <tt>insertRecord</tt> finds that 
there is already a record in the file with the given key it will not perform an 
insert but will return <tt>false</tt>. If <tt>findRecord</tt> cannot locate a 
record in the file with the given key it will return <tt>false</tt>.  Either 
method will return <tt>true</tt> if successful.
</p>

<p>
To <em>insert</em> a new record into the file the <tt>insertRecord</tt> 
method will use the key value to locate the sector in which the record should 
be placed.  It locates the sector by calling the (private) <tt>getSector</tt> 
method which reads the index described below.  The 
<tt>insertRecord</tt> method will then copy this sector to the disk buffer.
If a record with the same key is found as the new record to be inserted no 
further action will be taken and <tt>false</tt> will be returned.  Otherwise 
<tt>insertRecord</tt> will copy the record into an available position (if there 
is one) in the disk buffer, write the disk buffer back to the disk, and 
return <tt>true</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If the sector read was full <tt>insertRecord</tt> will read the
<em>overflow</em> sectors sequentially until either it finds a record with the
given key (in which case it returns <tt>false</tt>) or finds an overflow sector
which has space available for a new record,  The new record is then inserted
into this sector.  Of course, the overflow sectors are read and written by
copying the sectors to the disk buffer and, if called for, modifying the disk
buffer which is then written back to the disk.
</p>

<p>
<tt>findRecord</tt> will use the (private) <tt>getSector</tt> method to
locate the sector in which the record should be located.  If the record is found 
there  the record will be copied (as described above) into the parameter string.  
If the record is <em>not</em> found and <em>if the sector is full</em> the
overflow sectors will be searched sequentially to find the requested record.
</p>


<h3>The overflow sectors</h3>

<p>
When a new record cannot be inserted into the sector indicated by the index it
is put into an <em>overflow sector</em>.  The records are placed into the 
overflow sectors in the order in which the insertions are done.  I.e., they are 
not in any sorted order -- if the records in the overflow sectors are viewed as 
a list of records, a new record is just placed at the end.
</p>

<p>
The first time an "overflow record" is written to the file the first overflow
sector is allocated.  This will be the first sector on the disk <em>after</em>
the index.  When this sector is filled and another overflow record is to be
written the <em>next sector on the disk</em> is allocated as an overflow
sector, etc.  Thus the overflow sectors will form a sequential block of sectors.
</p>

<p>
The first overflow sector is allocated by placing its sector number in the
<tt>overflowStart</tt> field of the <tt>IndexedFile</tt> class and setting
<tt>overflowSectors</tt> to 1.  Thereafter <tt>overflowSectors</tt> is just
incremented to allocate a new disk sector.
</p>

<h3>The index</h3>

<p>
The index will be a <em>multi-way tree</em>.  That is it will be a tree where
each node can have up to <tt>n</tt> children where the integer <tt>n</tt> will
depend on the key size and on the size of the disk sectors.
</p>

<p>
Each node of the tree will be held in one sector.  An <em>index record</em>
will have two fields:  a <em>key field</em> and a <em>sector number field</em>.
Both of these fields are stored as '\000'-terminated character arrays (see below 
for a brief discussion of this).  The key field is the same length as the key 
field of the data being stored in the file. The sector number field holds the 
number of the sector where the data record with the corresponding key (and 
several more data records) can be found.  This number is stored <em>as 
characters which represent the digits of the decimal representation of the 
number</em>.  The sector number field is seven characters long, enough space for 
six digits and a terminator.  Thus the sector number field can store values from 
0 to 999999.  The index records are arranged one after another in the sector.  
The sector number fields can be viewed as pointers to a child node in the tree 
or, in the case of a leaf node, to a data sector.
</p>

<p>
The index is built <em>after</em> 
the data sectors (but no overflow sectors) have been written to the disk.  The 
data records will be arranged in (ascending) sorted key order on the disk.  If 
<tt>n</tt> is the number of index records in a sector then the <em>lowest</em> 
row of the tree is constructed first as follows:  The key from the first data 
record in the first data sector (and the sector number) form the first index 
record in the first index sector, the key from the first data record in the 
second data sector (and the sector number) form the second index record of the 
first index record, and so forth. After <tt>n</tt> index records have been 
created the sector is filled (and written to disk) and the process continues 
building the second index sector using the <em>next disk sector</em> after the 
one just written.  This continues until index records have been created for 
every data sector in the file.  This process is repeated to create a row of 
"nodes" (sectors) with records which point to the just created <em>index 
sectors</em>.  Further rows are created until a row consisting of a single 
sector is created.  This will be the root of the index tree and its sector 
number will be the <tt>indexRoot</tt> field of the <tt>IndexedFile</tt> class.  
Note that the root will be the <em>last</em> sector stored in the index.</p>

<p>
The code for creating the index must be in a class other than the <tt>IndexedFile</tt>
class.
</p>

<h3>The application</h3>

<p>
You will create an instance of <tt>Disk</tt> and an instance of 
<tt>IndexedFile</tt> which uses that disk.  The disk will have 10000 sectors, 
each having 512 characters.  A file with (sorted) data will be provided to you. 
Your program will read this file, build records, and write them into consecutive 
disk sectors beginning at sector 1000 of your simulated disk.  When you initially
build the data sectors leave space in each sector for <em>three</em>
additional records.  Thus several insertions can be made into any sector before 
it is necessary to write to an overflow sector.  Your program will then build an
index, as described above, beginning with the first sector following those used
for data.  The sectors immediately following the index will be used for
overflow.
</p>

<p>
The records you store will contain information on various mountains around the
world.  A record will consist of 60 characters and will have three fields:
</p><ul>
<li>name: 27 characters (the key field)</li>
<li>country: 27 characters</li>
<li>altitude (in feet): 6 characters</li>
</ul>

The characters will be either data characters or '\000' which terminate
the strings and fill out the remainder of the fields.  Altitudes will be
stored as character strings, not ints.
<p></p>

<p>
Your program will open a (real) file containing records in the format:
</p><pre><tt><blockquote>
Shasta, Mount#United States#14162
</blockquote></tt></pre>
with each record on its own line.  The program will reformat each line from the 
input into the 60-character record format and build the data sectors and index.
 If the data read is too long to fit into the field truncate the data to fit.
The program will then go into a loop displaying a menu offering the choices:
<ul>
<li>Insert new record</li>
<li>Find record</li>
<li>Quit</li>
</ul>
and accept the user's choice.  If the user chooses "Insert new record" the 
program will prompt for the three fields, format a 60-character record with the 
data, And insert the record.  The program will display whether the insertion
was successful or not.  If the user chooses "Find record" the program will
prompt for the mountain's name (the key) and will search for a record with that
key. If a record is found its fields will be displayed in the format:
<pre><tt><blockquote>
Shasta, Mount, country: United States, altitude: 14162 ft.
</blockquote></tt></pre>
If no record is found a message to that effect will be displayed.  The program 
will run until the user chooses "Quit."
<p></p>

<h3>On character arrays and Strings</h3>

<p>
In working with sectors and records you will need to put the character contents 
of Strings into character arrays and to put parts of character arrays into 
Strings.  Some useful methods for this follow.
</p>

Methods from String class

<tt><blockquote><pre>public void getChars(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, char[] dest, int destBegin)
<blockquote>
Copies a substring to a character array.
srcBegin -- index of first char in the string to copy
srcEnd -- index after the last char in the string to copy
dest -- the destination array
destBegin -- the start index in the destination array
Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
</blockquote>
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<tt><blockquote><pre>public String subString(int beginIndex)
<blockquote>
Returns a substring of the original string beginning with the character at 
beginIndex to the end of the original string.
Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
</blockquote>
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<tt><blockquote><pre>public String subString(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
<blockquote>
Returns a substring of the original string beginning with the character at 
beginIndex ending at character at endIndex - 1.
Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
</blockquote>
</pre></blockquote></tt>

<tt><blockquote><pre>public char charAt(int index)
<blockquote>
Returns the character at index.
Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
</blockquote>
</pre></blockquote></tt>

The NULL character, to be used in character arrays as a terminator and to fill 
out parts of a record, can be represented as <tt>'\000'</tt> or 
<tt>(char)0</tt>.

<h3>To hand in</h3>
<p>
You will hand in (all in hardcopy) your source code, 
a sample terminal session, and a sheet stating which parts of the assignment (if 
any) are incomplete.  For the terminal session you will use "mountain data" in 
the format described above.  A file containing the initial data to store on your 
disk (a <em>large</em> number of mountains) will be made available for download 
from the class website.  A list of commands to use for your terminal session 
will also be posted there.
